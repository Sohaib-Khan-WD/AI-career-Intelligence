🌟 Why This Stands Out
Unlike traditional ATS systems that rely on simple keyword matching, our platform uses context-aware AI that understands:

Skill relationships and equivalents (React = React.js = ReactJS)

Experience levels and seniority requirements

Industry-specific terminology and jargon

Implicit requirements from job description context
